# layer-light-3d
 Construct 3 Layer light 3D effect

#### Notes
- Use effect on layer or layout.
- Layer width, height: viewport resolution
- Layer depth: far clippling plane (10000 default in C3)
- Specular power: how narrow/wide specular spot is
- Normal debug: show the 'normal color' calculated instead of lighting
- Normal step: control variation of normal based on depth changes, may need to be adjusted for resolution?
- Ambient color: control non directional light / color, set to black for no ambient light
- Light X,Y,Z: light location in viewport, depth is in range of 1-10000, experiment with depth in effect! May invert later?
- Specular X,Y,Z light location in viewport, depth is in range of 1-10000, experiment with depth in effect! May invert later?
